# Local-Chatting-Web-Application
This is a web application which enables the users in same network to chat.

I have not focused on front end or UI as main aim was to work with php and MySQL to create a chat functionality.

I have used a template for login page and I have given credits to the owner in header and footer. If someone want to use make sure not to remove those headers and footers.
Fonts-aswome folder is not included in this repository, you can download and use it and change the reuqired file paths.

PHP and MySQL are used ata backend. MySQL stores the email, password and all user details and chat messages. Under db folder there is sql file of required tables.
